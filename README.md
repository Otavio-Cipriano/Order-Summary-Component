## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS extension language
- [Bem](http://getbem.com/) - CSS naming convention

### What I learned

During this project, I practice a bit more about Bem, a CSS naming covention and SASS as an extension language

### Continued development

In my next project i plan to keep using SASS and BEM, but using them together with webpack or some another module bundler

### Useful resources

- [Sass, Documentation](https://sass-lang.com/) - This is the documentation to SASS he helped me for understand what i could do and what i shouldn't do
